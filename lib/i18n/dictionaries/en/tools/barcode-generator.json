    ],
    "proTips": [
      "Use SVG format for barcodes that need to scale to any size without quality loss",
      "Enable quiet zones (margins) to improve scanner readability - most scanners require at least 2.5mm",
      "Test your barcode with the built-in scanner before printing to avoid costly reprints",
      "Use Code 128 for alphanumeric data - it's the most space-efficient 1D barcode",
      "For retail products in Europe use EAN-13, in USA/Canada use UPC-A",
      "Generate Data Matrix for small items - it's readable even at 2-3mm size",
      "Use batch mode with CSV import to generate hundreds of barcodes in seconds",
      "Print at 300+ DPI resolution for professional quality and reliable scanning"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "Scanner can't read: Increase size, check quiet zones (margins), verify contrast ratio, ensure print quality is 300+ DPI",
      "Invalid data error: Each format has specific character limitations - check the format info panel for allowed characters",
      "Checksum mismatch: Use auto-calculate checksum feature - manual checksums often contain errors",
      "Barcode too large for label: Switch to a more compact format (e.g., UPC-E instead of UPC-A, or Data Matrix for 2D)",
      "Colors not working: Ensure high contrast - dark bars on light background work best. Use contrast checker tool",
      "Batch generation fails: Check CSV format - one value per line, no headers, UTF-8 encoding"
