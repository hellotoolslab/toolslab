    "proTips": [
      "Binary input can be space-separated (01001000 01100101) or continuous (0100100001100101)",
      "Hex input supports 0x prefix (0x48656C6C6F) or space-separated (48 65 6C 6C 6F)",
      "Use the swap button to quickly verify round-trip conversion",
      "The tool auto-detects if your input looks like binary, hex, or text",
      "Each ASCII character uses exactly 8 bits (1 byte)",
      "UTF-8 characters may use 1-4 bytes depending on the character"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "If binary conversion fails, ensure only 0s and 1s are present",
      "Hex values must use valid characters (0-9 and A-F)",
      "Invalid characters will show an error message",
      "Very long inputs may take a moment to process",
      "Non-ASCII characters are converted using UTF-8 encoding",
      "Ensure binary input length is divisible by 8 for proper character conversion"
