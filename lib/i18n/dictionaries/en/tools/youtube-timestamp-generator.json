    "proTips": [
      "Always start with 00:00 - YouTube requires the first chapter to begin at the start",
      "Use descriptive but concise chapter titles (under 100 characters recommended)",
      "Add at least 3 chapters - YouTube won't display chapters with fewer entries",
      "Keep chapters at least 10 seconds apart for YouTube to recognize them",
      "Include key topics in chapter titles for better search visibility",
      "Use the time converter to quickly check duration between chapters",
      "Import chapters from your script or outline before recording",
      "Copy chapters to a text file as backup before publishing",
      "Use consistent naming conventions across your video series",
      "Add the video URL to generate shareable timestamp links for social media"

      "Video URL not recognized: Make sure it's a valid YouTube URL. The tool supports youtube.com/watch, youtu.be, and embed formats.",
      "Timestamps not in order: The tool automatically sorts timestamps chronologically when generating output.",
      "Import not working: Each chapter should be on its own line with format 'MM:SS Title' or 'HH:MM:SS Title'.",
      "Links not appearing: Add a valid YouTube video URL to enable timestamp link generation.",
      "Chapter titles cut off: YouTube truncates long titles. Keep them under 100 characters.",
      "Copied but not working: Make sure to paste in the video description, not the title or tags field."
