    "troubleshooting": [
      "Formatting not appearing: Ensure you're copying the formatted text, not the original. The Unicode characters carry the formatting.",
      "Text looks different on LinkedIn: Some Unicode styles render slightly different across devices. Bold and italic are most consistent.",
      "Character count exceeded: LinkedIn has a 3,000 character limit. Unicode formatting doesn't add extra characters.",
      "Formatting removed after posting: LinkedIn occasionally strips certain Unicode ranges. Stick to standard bold and italic for best results.",
      "Preview differs from actual post: Preview is an approximation. LinkedIn's rendering may vary slightly.",
      "Bullet points not aligned: Use consistent bullet styles. Mixing Unicode bullets may cause alignment issues.",
      "Mobile preview not accurate: Actual mobile rendering depends on device and app version. Preview shows general appearance.",
      "Copy button not working: Ensure your browser allows clipboard access. Try selecting and copying manually."
