      "Use cost factor 10 or higher for production passwords",
      "Each hash is unique even for the same password due to random salts",
      "Higher cost factors exponentially increase computation time (each +1 doubles time)",
      "Never store plain-text passwords - always use bcrypt or similar algorithms",

      "Slow generation: Reduce cost factor for faster hashing (but less security)",

      "Browser freezes: Very high cost factors (12+) may temporarily freeze the browser",
      "Hash format issues: Valid bcrypt hashes always start with $2a$, $2b$, or $2y$"
