      "Text not displaying: Some older devices may not support all Unicode fonts. Stick to bold, italic, or monospace for maximum compatibility.",
      "Characters appear as boxes: This means the font isn't supported on that platform. Use the platform compatibility checker to verify before posting.",
      "Text looks different on mobile vs desktop: Unicode rendering varies slightly by device. Always preview on your target device before publishing.",
      "Instagram removing styled text: Instagram occasionally blocks certain Unicode ranges. If text disappears, try a different font style.",
      "Character counter shows red: Your text exceeds Instagram's limits (150 for bio, 2200 for posts). Shorten your message or remove extra characters.",
      "Copy button not working: Ensure your browser allows clipboard access. Try clicking the button again or manually select and copy the text.",
      "Emojis not converting: Emojis are preserved in their original form - they don't need conversion and work across all platforms.",
      "Search not finding fonts: Use simple terms like 'bold', 'italic', or 'script'. Font names are in English."
