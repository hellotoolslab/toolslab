    "troubleshooting": [
      "Indentation error: YAML uses spaces, not tabs. Check that indentation is consistent throughout the file.",
      "Unexpected end of stream: Usually means unclosed quotes or brackets. Check for matching pairs.",
      "Duplicate key: Same key appears twice in a mapping. Rename or remove the duplicate.",
      "Bad indentation of a mapping entry: Child elements must be indented more than parents.",
      "Could not find expected ':': Missing colon after a key. Add ': ' after the key name.",
      "Block sequence entries not allowed in this context: Check that list items are properly indented.",
      "Implicit keys need to be on a single line: Long keys should use explicit notation with '?'.",
