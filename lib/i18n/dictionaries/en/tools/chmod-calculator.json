    "proTips": [
      "755 is the standard for directories and executable scripts",
      "644 is the standard for regular files (owner can write, others can read)",
      "Never use 777 on production servers - it's a security risk",
      "Use 600 for sensitive files like SSH keys and configuration files",
      "The recursive flag (-R) applies permissions to all files and subdirectories"
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
      "If a script doesn't run, check if execute (x) permission is set for the appropriate user",
      "Permission denied errors often mean the current user lacks read or execute permissions",
      "Web files typically need 644 (files) and 755 (directories) for proper access",
      "Remember: directories need execute permission to be accessible"
